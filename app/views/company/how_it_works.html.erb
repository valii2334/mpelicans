  Share a memory
  If you want to share a memory, firstly, you have to create a journey. 
  After a journey is made, you can add multiple stops to it. For example, you are going to Italy tomorrow. 
  It's a perfect time to create a journey. The title could be 'Excited to visit Italy for my first time.' 
  In the description, you can add a few ideas from your plans, and remember to add some pictures.
  After you create a journey, you can add multiple stops to it. For example,
  after arriving in Italy, you find a great pizzeria. Create a stop for it. 
  Add a title, description, and a few pictures. A new detail, a very important one, is the location. 
  The location is essential because other travelers can save it to their map and visit it later.
  Remember to add a stop to your journey each time you see something, visit something, or see fantastic scenery.
